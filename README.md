# Electric-Tank
This was a team project between two people during my freshmen year of high school where we were tasked with assembly and creation of tank treads and a body. 
We used andymark rhino drive tank treads and with a water jet cut aluminum plates into shape to assemble them, then we used alumium boxchannel and 0.5in wood to create the body of our vehicle. Next we added a sabertooth motor controller module and a radio transmitter to connect with a simple controllers to allow us to remotely operate the vehicle.
